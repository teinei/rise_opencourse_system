============================================

OK, a lot of people want these, (including me)
and I had a little free time, so I made a list.
It's far from complete though, I'll add stuff
when I have time. Also, since English is not my
main langauge, some of the quotes may be incorrect,
and there are a few of them that I can't understand.
I wrote all this stuff in 2 days, so don't be surprised
if some of the units are not in the list.

If you have anything to add, feel free to contact me.

Updated at 2003. X. 18.
----------- Added some corrections, thx goes out to BronzeLambReg.
Updated at 2003. V. 10.
----------- Giga update - added each and every quote,
 in the order they are in the soundmd.ini file

notes:

Select: What a unit will say if you select it.

Move: What a unit will say if you order it to move somewhere.

Attack: what a unit will say if you order it to attack.

Fear: what a unit will say if their Health drops very quickly.

Harvest: what a miner will say if you order it on Ore

Special: anything else I found

The stuff I put in " " after the units name is said by the unit
when it's built, and the whole map will hear it.

I got the number of different sounds from the soundmd.ini file
of the game, so the number of them are correct, that's how
I know which one of them are missing.
About the quotes that were present in RA2 too, they are listed
in the String files (*.csf) that the game uses, so as long as
those files are right, the qoutes are right too.
If not, blame Westwood, not me.

If I didn't understood a word, I put ??? in the place of it.
If there is a (???) after the qoute, then I'm not sure
about that one. If theres only a (???) and nothing else,
then I totally can't understand that quote. Just one ? and
nothing else means that I will add that one later, when I find it.

Again, feel free to contribute.
